MinecraftSocial
===============

MinecraftSocial is a project I've developed for my personal Minecraft Server.

It allows users to create an account, give status updates to other members, and converse via a live chat.

The feature list is as follows:

* Administration via one administrator account
* Server Polling (Online or Offline, and how many users are on)
* File Server for sharing files, complete with upload script for members
* Bulletin Board for posting discussions between members
* Announcement Panel so Administrators can warn of potential downtimes or new features

Other benefits include the following:

* It's secure (based on [phpSecureLogin](http://github.com/peredurabefrog/phpSecureLogin))
* It's easy (simple to install, only requires LAMP stack)

MinecraftSocial is based on (and incredibly grateful to) the following:

* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) and [jQuery](jquery.com)
* [phpSecureLogin](http://github.com/peredurabefrog/phpSecureLogin)

I'm happy to receive any suggestions (chandler@chandlerswift.com). Also, development help would be greatly appreciated!
